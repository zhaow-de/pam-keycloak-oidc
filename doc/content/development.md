# Development environment

## Documentation

The outline of this documentation is too complex to fit into a single README.md.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is used to render the static website hosted at Github Pages, and [Hugo Book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) is chosen as the theme.
A Github Actions workflow is configured to automatically build and publish the changes merged to the `main` branch.

Please follow the [instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/) to setup the local development environment.
